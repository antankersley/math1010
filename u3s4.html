      <h2>Geometry Unit</h2>
  

      <h3>3.4 Problem Solving with Units</h3>
      <h4>Examples</h4>
      <p>•	Consider paying $35.25 to fill a 15-gallon tank with gasoline. What is the price per gallon? How many gallons do you get for a dollar?</p>
      <p>•	A 16 oz box of Great Grains Crunchy Pecan cereal is $3.46. What is the unit price? How many ounces per dollar?</p>
      <p>•	If you left a lamp with a single 60-watt lightbulb turned on all day and night for a year, how much would the electricity cost if you pay 12 cents per kilowatt-hour? How much would you save for the year if you turned the light off at night for 8 hours while you sleep?

    </p>
<h4>Group Activity</h4>
<p><b>Use unit analysis and your problem-solving skills to answer the following questions.</b></p>
<ol>
<li>You plan to go to Myrtle Beach during spring break with two of your friends. It’s 412 miles to the beach from Knoxville. You will be driving a Honda CR-V which averages 28 miles per gallon on the highway. Gas prices are currently $2.15 per gallon. How much should you budget for gasoline on the trip if you split the cost equally with your friends?</li>

<p class="solution"></p>

<li>Your bathtub measures 5 feet by 2 feet by 1.25 feet. The flow rate of water through your bathtub spout is 4 gallons per minute. How long will it take to fill your bathtub ¾ of the way to the top?</li>
<li>You have an old clothes dryer that uses 4000 watts of power. You are thinking about replacing it with a new, more energy-efficient model. A new dryer uses only 2000 watts of power but costs $650 to purchase. Your electric company charges 11 cents per kilowatt-hour of electricity. If you run your dryer 1 hour each day, how long will it take you to recoup the purchase cost of the new dryer.</li>
<li>You want to spray weed killer on the weeds by the curb near your house. You have a bottle of weed killer concentrate that must be mixed with water before spraying. The directions say to mix 6 fluid ounces of weed killer concentrate per gallon of water. You want to mix the weed killer in a 1-quart spray bottle. How many tablespoons of concentrate should you mix with a quart of water?</li>
<li>Which is the better buy: 27 double rolls of Scott bath tissue with 1000 sheets per roll (2829 square feet total) for $16.97 OR 24 double rolls of Walmart brand bath tissue with 1000 sheets per roll (2528 square feet total) for $12.52.</li>
<li>Your young nephew has a cold and you need to give him some liquid Benadryl for his symptoms. He weighs 45 pounds, so the dosage recommendation is 7.5 milliliters every 6 hours. How many teaspoons of Benadryl should you give him for one dose? If the 100 ml bottle of Benadryl is only half full, how many days will the bottle last if you give your nephew three doses a day?</li>
<li>The population of the U.S. is 325,552,686 people. The land area of the U.S. is 3.797 million square miles.  What is the population density of the U.S.? China has 3.705 million square miles and a population of 1,385,923,186 people. How many times greater is the population density of China compared to the U.S.?</li>
